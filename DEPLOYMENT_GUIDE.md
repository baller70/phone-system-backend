# üéâ Automated Phone System - Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Your Flask application is **RUNNING** and ready to receive calls!

- **Application Status**: ‚úÖ Running on port 5000
- **Health Check**: ‚úÖ Passing (http://localhost:5000/health)
- **Dependencies**: ‚úÖ All installed
- **Local Access**: http://localhost:5000

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Issues to Address

### 1. Missing Vonage Private Key
**Status**: ‚ùå Critical - Required for Vonage API authentication

The application is looking for a private key file at `./private.key` but it doesn't exist. You need to:

1. Go to your [Vonage Dashboard](https://dashboard.vonage.com/)
2. Navigate to **Applications** ‚Üí Select your application (ID: `5f33f5f3-8898-4675-ad58-7823db96a34d`)
3. Download the **Private Key** file
4. Save it as `private.key` in `/home/ubuntu/github_repos/auto_call_system/`

**Command to upload the key:**
```bash
# After downloading from Vonage, upload it to:
/home/ubuntu/github_repos/auto_call_system/private.key
```

### 2. Cal.com API Token Issue
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning - Calendar integration won't work

The Cal.com API token in your `.env` file is returning a 401 error. You may need to:
- Verify the token is correct
- Check if it has expired
- Ensure it has the right permissions

---

## üåê Making Your Application Publicly Accessible

Since Vonage needs to send webhooks to your application, you need a **public URL**. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Using ngrok (Recommended for Testing)

**Step 1**: Get an ngrok account and auth token
1. Sign up at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
2. Get your auth token from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

**Step 2**: Configure ngrok
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
```

**Step 3**: Start ngrok tunnel
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/auto_call_system
ngrok http 5000
```

**Step 4**: Copy the public URL
You'll see output like:
```
Forwarding   https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
```

Your webhook URLs will be:
- **Answer URL**: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/answer`
- **Event URL**: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/events`
- **Speech URL**: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/speech`

### Option 2: Using Cloudflare Tunnel (Free, No Account Required)

```bash
# Install cloudflared
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64
chmod +x cloudflared-linux-amd64
sudo mv cloudflared-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cloudflared

# Start tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5000
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Production Server

For production use, deploy to:
- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with free tier
- **DigitalOcean**: $5/month droplet
- **AWS EC2**: Free tier available
- **Railway**: Modern deployment platform

## üîß Configure Vonage Webhooks

Once you have a public URL, configure it in your Vonage Application:

1. Go to [Vonage Dashboard](https://dashboard.vonage.com/)
2. Navigate to **Applications** ‚Üí Your Application
3. Under **Capabilities** ‚Üí **Voice**, set:
   - **Answer URL**: `https://YOUR-PUBLIC-URL/webhooks/answer` (HTTP POST)
   - **Event URL**: `https://YOUR-PUBLIC-URL/webhooks/events` (HTTP POST)
4. Click **Save changes**

## üìã Complete Setup Checklist

- [x] Flask application running on port 5000
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [ ] **Upload Vonage private key to `/home/ubuntu/github_repos/auto_call_system/private.key`**
- [ ] Fix Cal.com API token (optional, for calendar features)
- [ ] Set up ngrok or another tunneling service
- [ ] Configure webhook URLs in Vonage Dashboard
- [ ] Test incoming call

---

## üß™ Testing Your System

### 1. Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-30T21:18:01.660875",
  "vonage_client": true
}
```

### 2. Test Answer Webhook (Simulated)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/webhooks/answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "14155551234",
    "to": "19095779171",
    "uuid": "test-call-uuid",
    "conversation_uuid": "test-conversation-uuid"
  }'
```

### 3. Make a Real Test Call
Once webhooks are configured, call your Vonage number: **+1 (909) 577-9171**

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is already in use
sudo lsof -i :5000

# Kill existing process if needed
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Restart application
cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/auto_call_system
python3 app.py
```

### Vonage client initialization failed
- Ensure `private.key` file exists in the project directory
- Verify the file has the correct permissions: `chmod 600 private.key`
- Check that the Application ID in `.env` matches your Vonage dashboard

### Webhooks not receiving calls
- Verify your public URL is accessible: `curl https://YOUR-URL/health`
- Check Vonage Dashboard ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Webhooks are configured
- Look at Flask logs for incoming requests
- Check Vonage Dashboard ‚Üí Logs for webhook delivery status

### Cal.com integration not working
- Verify API token is valid
- Check that `CALCOM_EVENT_TYPE_ID` is set correctly
- This is optional - the system can work without calendar integration
