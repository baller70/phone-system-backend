# IVR Routing System Implementation

## Overview
A professional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system that greets callers and routes them to the appropriate department or service using keypad (DTMF) input.

## Features

### 1. Professional Greeting
When customers call, they hear:
"Thank you for calling Premier Sports Facility! Please listen carefully to the following options..."

### 2. Menu Options
The system offers 6 routing options:

- Press 1: Basketball Court Rentals - Book courts, check pricing, verify availability
- Press 2: Birthday Party Packages - Party bookings, packages, planning assistance
- Press 3: Multi-Sport Activities - Volleyball, dodgeball, and other sports
- Press 4: Corporate Events & Leagues - Team building, tournaments, league info
- Press 9: AI Assistant - Full conversational AI for any questions
- Press 0: Live Operator - Connect to a human representative

### 3. Department-Specific Greetings
After selecting an option, callers hear a customized greeting and then speak naturally with the AI.

### 4. Intelligent Context Setting
The system automatically sets the service context based on menu selection so customers don't have to repeat themselves.

## Call Flow
1. Customer calls
2. IVR Menu plays with options (1-4, 9, 0)
3. Customer presses a key
4. System routes to appropriate department or operator
5. Department greeting plays
6. AI conversation begins with service context pre-set
7. Booking/inquiry handled by AI

## Deployment
The new endpoint /webhooks/dtmf handles keypad input routing.
All changes are backward compatible with existing functionality.
